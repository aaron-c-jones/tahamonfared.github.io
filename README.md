Hello world! 

I'm Taha, a statistics student, who will probably encounter some obstacles while trying to get a hang on 
things. Which may happen to all of us! 

This is my way to communicate my solutions to others. In doing so, I will remember my solution, while learning
better ways form others.

Stats on and enjoy!

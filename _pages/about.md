Hi everyone! I'm Taha Monfared, a statistics graduate student. I have designed this website to work as a diary to me and maybe a good dictionary of things that may go wrong in your conceptual problems and perhaps coding problems! There is no easy way to learn what we do, and there is undoubtedly no easy way to code in R, without checking StackOverflow once in a while. 

This website can be a small reflection of the knowledge dispersed on the web that had helped me achieve what I've presented here. It could help you if you have the same problems, or you may enlighten me about other possible solutions to my questions. 

Although this is not the place, I think I should thank my professors here at CSU Fullerton, as they have guided me towards a better understanding of mathematical backbone of statistics, honing my skills and inflaming my thirst for more statistical knowledge. I encourage every data scientist, data analyst, machine learning expert, data analytics expert, or statistician to get dirty with the theories behind statistical tools. Maybe someday we can evolve it even further. 

I am currently considering pursuing Ph.D. Although I am 33 now- and that's worrying to me - academic growth has given me such pleasure throughout these last few years, that I may have got addicted to it.  

Aside from academics, I am new to United States job market. I have been a research assistant to CSUF graduate office for around two years and as impressive as it had been. I wouldn't be a student here anymore after this January. So if anyone is interested in recruiting a statistician or a data analyst, I am available to hire. My LinkedIn profile includes most of the information provided in my resume. But just in case [My Resume](/assets/TahaMonfared_Resume.pdf) can be printed out following the hyperlink.

Best to you all in your statistical journies.

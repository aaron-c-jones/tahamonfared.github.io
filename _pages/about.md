Hi everyone! I'm Taha Monfared, an enthusiast for learning anything data related! You can print out [My Resume](/assets/TahaMonfared_Resume.pdf) if you are looking for a data scientist to add to your team.

I have developed this website to work as a diary for me and a reference for conceptual/coding problems that may hinder any of us.  

This website is a reflection of the knowledge dispersed on the web (StackOverflow & other sources) that had helped me along the way, combined with my original code and proofs. 
 
I should thank my professors at CSU Fullerton and CSU East Bay (who I miss dearly), as they have guided me towards a better understanding of mathematical backbone of statistics. I encourage every data scientist, data analyst, machine learning expert, data analyst, or statistician to get dirty with the theories behind statistical tools. 

Enjoy, Communicate and Stats on!

There are some tricky stuff in R you need to remember. I will need to update this post as these stuff come up. 

If you want to pass on a text to be converted to a function in R you will need to do so in this way:

"eval(parse(text = paste0(...)))"

```{r}
library(scales)
ECDF<-function(dist, params){
  plot(ecdf(eval(parse(text = paste0("r", dist, "(1000 ,",params,")")))),
       main = "Empirical CDF", col = alpha("blue",.5), lwd = 3)
}

ECDF("norm","mean = 5, sd = 1")

```

Seems easy here, since you basically didn't need it. But sometimes in a function you'll need to do this. Here is an example in Shiny.
